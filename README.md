# nodeDepth
Depth-first searcher
Assignment: Write code that can search for a node in a tree. Return the node if it exists, and null/nil/none/undefined/false 
as appropriate in your language if not. For example, if the code is given "g" and a tree with the structure above, it should 
return the node named "g".
Goal: A visual representation of the program using bootstrap, jQuery and html (minimal css left to in line).

Getting Started
Nothing further needed for getting started other than a text editor. I would recommend Visual Studio Code. 

Prerequisites
None

Running the tests
The corresponding fields A,B,C,D,E,F have a hidden input value with a field. When you search for the "node" if it 
exists the value of the input field at the node will be display. If there is nothing in the node a message notifying
you that nothing is there populates. If a node that does not exist is requested, a message will be produced notifying
the user that the node does not exist.
